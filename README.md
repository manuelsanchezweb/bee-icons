## üçØ Why this project

**We really love icons.**

We do it to the extent to feel really chilled when we create them.

For some people, drawing or coloring mandalas might work, this works for us.

And also we can use them lately in our projects.

We got really inspired by bigger projects like [thenounproject](https://thenounproject.com/) and [tabler-icons](https://tabler-icons.io/), and decided to go create something as cool.

By the way, **if you want to give a try to mindful creating icons, you can always create a PR**. Just add some icons in the file `icons.json`. We will take a look carefully!

All the icons are completely made by us from the very first pixel and free to use it, **either in personal or commercial projects**.

## ü™ú Next Steps

- [x] Add thumbnail for sharing the app
- [x] Create component that renders the icon (24x24) by default
- [ ] Create functions that get the icon by name, and also get other icon sizes by name
- [x] Create search filter function
- [x] Create the icon Hive Cell component
- [x] Create a simple pagination system (show max number of icon per view)
- [x] Click the icon will download automatically 24x24 version (later we will have a modal)
- [ ] Add glassmorphism background
- [x] Add filter by category
