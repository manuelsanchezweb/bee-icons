## 🍯 Why this project

**We really love icons.**

We do it to the extent to feel really chilled when we create them.

For some people, drawing or coloring mandalas might work, this works for us.

And also we can use them lately in our projects.

We got really inspired by bigger projects like [thenounproject](https://thenounproject.com/) and [tabler-icons](https://tabler-icons.io/), and decided to go create something as cool.

By the way, **if you want to give a try to mindful creating icons, you can always create a PR**. We will take a look carefully!

All the icons are completely free to use it, **either in personal or commercial projects**.
